## Course Description

This course introduces the fundamental concepts of computing and
networking, with an emphasis on the role these technologies play in
creating, manipulating, storing, and accessing information. Topics
essential to the work done by information professionals will be
highlighted: web technologies, database concepts, markup languages, data
management, and design and accessibility. Students will conduct frequent
hands-on activities to acquire skills that are immediately applicable to
working with information technologies. The course will explore recent
trends in technology within information organizations, preparing
students for their roles as information professionals and providing the
foundation for future technology-related coursework.

**The goals of this course are to:**

-   Introduce fundamental concepts of information technology
    infrastructure, internet, and web design principles

-   Develop a general understanding of the information technologies used
    for creating, managing, storing, and accessing information

-   Understand contemporary issues and trends in the development and
    changes of information technologies and their impact on information
    organizations

**Upon successful completion of this course, a student will be able
to:**

-   Understand, use, discuss, and be able to help others with core
    computing technologies, including hardware, operating systems,
    software applications, Internet/web technologies and assistive
    technologies.

-   Evaluate different technologies to determine the most appropriate
    infrastructure, systems, and tools needed to solve a problem or
    achieve a goal.

-   Be able to use up-to-date web technologies to edit and maintain a
    substantial website.

-   Ability to use critical approaches when evaluating information
    technologies, including the evaluation of technology-related current
    events.

**NOTES:**

-   Aspects of this course are subject to change at the discretion of
    the instructor. Any modifications will be announced and documented
    in a timely fashion.

-   This is not necessarily a skills class. Although we will study and
    use specific technologies, such as HTML, CSS and other related
    tools, the focus of the course will be on the role of these
    technologies in the information professions, not necessarily on full
    expertise in the skills themselves.

1)  **Prerequisites**

This is a graduate-level technology course. Although there are no
academic prerequisites, prior to enrolling in SILS, students must be
proficient in the skills listed in "The SILS Student Technology
Expectations" adopted and distributed to students since July 2006 (see
attached at end of syllabus). The course will move along under this
assumption and SILS faculty will provide no remedial assistance during
or outside of class.

2)  **Technology Tutoring**

Pratt SILS offers technology tutorial assistance to students taking 654
and other courses. Assistance with development components of assignments
should be directed to the tutor. The tutoring service is managed through
the SILS office and is available 20 hours a week either by walk-in or
appointment. For information on hours of operation, contact the SILS
office or see above.

## Projects, Papers, and Assignments

All graded assignments must be added to the class WordPress blog or
emailed to the instruction before class on the due date (unless
otherwise noted). If there is a medical or personal reason for absences
or late homework assignments, you must present your excuse in advance
and in writing, via email. Students who do not give advance notice and
receive approval will be subject to a **10% of grade per-day penalty**
on late homework assignments. Late assignments will receive a grade, but
may not receive feedback. Assignments more than 4 days late will not be
graded (and will earn a "0") unless you have prior written approval from
your instructor.

1.  Reflection Posts (25%)
2.  Technology and Service Inspiration Posts (10%)
3.  Personal Homepage (20%)
4.  Blank Technology Canvas Presentation (10%)
5.  Blank Technology Canvas Report (25%)
6.  Class discussion and participation (including News of the Week,
    In-class labs, guest speaker preparedness etc.) (10%)

**Reflection Posts (25%)**

Students will contribute three significant posts to the class blog over
the course of the semester. Initial topic suggestions and a
non-exhaustive list of potential sources will be distributed the first
day of class. The posts should be a minimum of 700 words in length, and
must include: an excerpted portion, quote, or embed (with Fair Use
criteria in mind see Fair Use appendix below) and direct link to the
source; a brief summary or explanation of the material with comment on
how the material was discovered; and the student\'s reflection, drawing
connections and parallels to material covered in class and/or ongoing
concerns to the library and archives communities. A separate assignment
sheet with specific blog post and format criteria will be distributed
the first day of class.

**Technology and Service Inspiration Posts (10%)**

Students will contribute three brief (150 word minimum) posts to the
class blog over the course of the semester. The posts should include: an
excerpted portion, quote, or embed (with Fair Use criteria in mind; see
Fair Use appendix below) and direct link to the source; and a brief
summary or explanation of the connection of the technology inspiration
source to the provision of service in an information resource setting. A
separate assignment sheet with specific blog post and format criteria
will be distributed the first day of class.

**Personal Homepage (20%)**

Using skills, tools, and technique introduced in class, students will
create a linked series of web documents featuring biographical
information, images, and outbound links relevant to student interests.
Required elements will include: a home page, three additional linked
pages, an external style sheet, hidden commented code in both HTML and
CSS documenting sections and style choices, at least one web-optimized
image on each page, inclusions of alt tags for accessibility, and at
least one HTML table element. The personal homepage should demonstrate
the cumulative knowledge of coding and design skills covered in the
course, as well as the integration of design considerations from other
sites and examples discussed in class. Students will host all files on
the server space provided by the Pratt Institute. A separate assignment
sheet with explicit requirements will be distributed in class.

**Blank Technology Canvas Pitch Presentation (10%)**

The ability to pitch ideas effectively to a group and to integrate
feedback are essential skills in any information profession. As a
precursor to the Blank Technology Canvas Proposal Report, students will
prepare a roughly five-minute in-class presentation, covering a proposed
vision for the space, their inspirations, and other relevant elements
supporting their proposal. Students will have the option of using
PowerPoint, Prezi (free education version), or other tools (upon
approval) to create the presentation. A separate assignment sheet will
be distributed in class.

**Blank Technology Canvas Proposal Site (25%)**

For this exercise, students will draft a proposal to develop a large
information service space for a user demographic of their choice.
Students will work under the assumption that a parent organization has
set aside space dedicated for this purpose, and have already secured
funding to award to a meritorious proposal. Basic IT and broadband
infrastructure are a given, but further potential uses for the space
will stem from the student's vision. The proposal should take into
account the specific needs of a particular target user demographic, and
will also require that students consider potential partner organizations
as well as areas of potential expansion. Likewise, students will include
with the proposal examples of sites -- real or conceptual -- that served
as inspiration. Students will receive feedback on their proposed ideas
in class before embarking on the final proposal report. A separate
assignment sheet detailing specifications and requirements will be
distributed in class.

## Attendance/Participation:

Attendance at all class meetings is required. A student who must be
absent from a class meeting still has certain responsibilities:

-   To inform the instructor in advance, or if advance notice is not
    possible, as soon after the absence as possible to arrange for
    delivery to the instructor of any assignment due at the class
    meeting.

-   To obtain notes, handouts, etc. from a classmate (in anticipation of
    this need, each student is advised to exchange contact information
    with one or two others in the class).

-   Points are deducted for: unexcused absences, coming late to class,
    or leaving class early.

-   Active participation includes, but is not limited to the following:

    -   Being involved in class discussions.

    -   Asking relevant questions, debating, or challenging points.

    -   Suggesting new ways of looking at things.

    -   Volunteering to take notes, organizing activities and helping
        other students.

## Written Work:

Students should always keep copies of all assignments that are turned
in. In the case of a piece of written work becoming lost, regardless of
fault, it is the responsibility of the student to provide a second copy.

## Academic Integrity Code

Academic integrity at Pratt means using your own and original ideas in
creating academic work. It also means that if you use the ideas or
influence of others in your work, you must acknowledge them. For more
information on Pratt’s Academic Integrity Standards, please visit
http://bit.ly/prattacademicintegrity.

## Students with Disabilities and Accessibility

Pratt Institute is committed to the full inclusion of all students. If
you are a student with a disability and require accommodations, please
contact the Learning/Access Center (L/AC) at LAC@pratt.edu to schedule
an appointment to discuss these accommodations. Students with
disabilities who have already registered with the L/AC are encouraged to
speak to the professor about accommodations they may need to produce an
accessible learning environment. 

Requests for accommodation should be made as far in advance as
reasonably possible to allow sufficient time to make any necessary
modifications to ensure the relevant classes, programs, or activities
are readily accessible. The Learning/Access Center is available to Pratt
students,confidentially, with additional resources and information to
facilitate full access to all campus programs and activities and provide
support related to any other disability-related matters. For more
information, please visit http://www.pratt.edu/accessibility/.

## Human Rights, Equity, BERT, and Title IX

Pratt Institute seeks to provide an environment that is free of bias,
discrimination, and harassment. If you have been the victim of
harassment, discrimination, bias, or sexual misconduct, we encourage you
to report this.

If you inform me (your professor) of an issue of harassment,
discrimination or bias, or sexual misconduct I will keep the information
as private as I can, but I am required to bring it to the attention of
the institution’s Title IX Coordinator. You can access Title IX services
by emailing titleix@pratt.edu. You can also speak to someone
confidentially by contacting our non-mandatory reporters: Health
Services at 718-399-4542, Counseling Services 718-687-5356 or Campus
Ministries 718-596-4840.

In cases of Bias, this information may go to our Bias Education &
Response Taskforce (BERT). You can contact BERT by either reaching out
directly via bert@pratt.edu or by contacting the BERT Co-Chair and Title
IX Coordinator, Dr. Esmilda Abreu. For more information, please refer to
the Community Standards webpage: http://bit.ly/prattcommunitystandards.

## Communication

The best way to contact the instructor via email
(<ashley.blewer@gmail.com>). I will
make every effort to respond within 24 hours during the school week,
though there may be a delay on weekends (weekends are important for
everyone!). Should this communication preference change, you will be
notified in advance. For questions pertaining to upcoming assignments,
make sure to contact us well in advance of the deadline such that you
can receive the necessary help prior to the deadline.

## Student Agreement

Attendance at this class signifies that the student has agreed to abide
by and adhere to the policies and regulations specified above. It is
understood that the instructor may adapt or change this syllabus and the
assignments contained within it according to circumstances that may
arise during the course of the class.

## Appendix: On Fair Use

Fair use is an extremely important facet of the information industry,
and is an essential component of the law to understand and be able to
clearly communicate to patrons, researchers, students, and anyone else
who might benefit from fair use.

17 U.S. Code § 107 - Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use
--------------------------------------------------------------

<http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107>

Notwithstanding the provisions of sections
[106](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106) and
[106A](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106A), the fair use
of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or
phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for
purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching
(including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or
research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether
the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the
factors to be considered shall include---

(1) **the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use
    is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational 
    purposes;**

(2) **the nature of the copyrighted work;**

(3) **the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to
    the copyrighted work as a whole; and**

(4) **the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of
    the copyrighted work.**

The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of
fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above
factors.
>
\-\--

The following are the best and most succinct informal criteria for fair
use I've heard:

1.  *Are you using the material to illustrate a specific point that
    you're trying to make?*

2.  *Are you only using so much as is necessary to make that point?*

3.  *Is it clear to the audience what that point is?*

As quoted in "[Fair Use Panel Cautions Against Adopting Georgia State
Ruling as
Definitive](http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2012/06/shows-events/ala/fair-use-panel-cautions-against-adopting-georgia-state-ruling-as-definitive-ala-annual-2012/)",
