## Blank Technology Canvas Pitch Presentation (10% of total grade)


### Due Dates
	Submit presentation via email: April 20  or 27 (order of presentations TBD)
	Give presentation in class: April 20 or 27 (order of presentations TBD)

### Background

The ability to pitch ideas effectively to a group and to integrate feedback are essential skills in the information professions. As preparation for the Blank Technology Canvas Proposal Report, students will prepare a roughly five- to seven minute in-class presentation, covering an initial vision for the space and user demographics, a number of inspirations, and other relevant elements that will support their proposal, such as potential partner organizations.

### Scope

Students will have the option of using PowerPoint, Keynote, Prezi (free education version), or other tools to create the presentation. In order to create a dynamic presentation consisting of more than just text, students will also include visual elements including photographs, screenshots, illustrations, or other means of depicting the proposed site and the technology to be used there.

### Requirements

• Develop a five- to seven-minute presentation (these will be timed), covering the following:  
    ◦ A specific description of the target user community, and the information need your site aims to address  
    ◦ A proposal pitch for an original space to satisfy your demographic’s information need  
    ◦ Technology inspirations for proposed services or offerings  
• Submit the presentation via email (attachment or link) by November 13  
• Give the presentation in class, which will be considered according to these criteria:  
    ◦ Preparedness (including use of time allotted)  
    ◦ Evidence of deep research in service of making a targeted and effective pitch  
    ◦ Synthesis of many sources and inspirations into a spoken and visual presentation form  
    ◦ Dynamic display of text and visual information using a presentation tool  
    ◦ Solicitation of feedback about the pitch following the presentation, and response to questions prompted by the pitch  


Presentations should also incorporate at least a few images (photographs, screenshots, etc.) or other multimedia in order to illustrate the proposal being described. Be sure to give attribution to any images you get from outside sources.

Note: If you choose to use a tool besides PowerPoint, Keynote, Google Slides, Slides.com, or Prezi, please have it approved in advance to make sure the software is available in the classroom to support your presentation.
